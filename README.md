Bitcoin related Go scripts. Mostly just hobby stuff for myself so I can get more familiar with Go.

## Bitcoin Price and Fees

Simple little Go script that displays the current Bitcoin price and recommended transaction fees in the terminal.

Example output:

```

  1 BTC = 1 BTC
  The recommended tx fees are:
    - Fast: 40 sat/byte
    - Half hour: 31 sat/byte
    - Hour: 27 sat/byte
